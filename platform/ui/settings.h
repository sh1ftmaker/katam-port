/* Player settings: presentation only.
 *
 * Everything here changes how a frame is shown or heard, never what the game
 * does: the renderer choice (PPU or render list, both of which read the same
 * console state), the GPU view rectangle and its scaling, the HUD's anchoring,
 * and the output volume.  None of them is written to game memory, none is in a
 * recording, and `make regress` (which never loads them) is unaffected.  The
 * one exception is deliberate: the game's spawn/despawn windows follow the
 * widest view the settings allow, which present.c hands the simulation as a
 * recorded request (PortSimViewRequest, docs/VIEW.md "Spawn margin").  While
 * a netplay session holds them at the original, a view past the spawn margin
 * shows pop-in; PortLayoutPastSpawnMargin says when.
 *
 * The settings menu (ui_menu.cpp) is a view over this struct; a later HTML or
 * native UI can drive the same struct and call PortSettingsChanged().
 *
 * Persisted as "key=value" lines: localStorage on the web
 * (host_web.c), settings.ini in SDL's pref dir natively (host_sdl.c).
