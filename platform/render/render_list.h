/* The render list: what the GPU renderer draws, built from game state.
 *
 * This is the durable half of the renderer.  The GL backend in gl_renderer.c
 * consumes it and is replaceable; the list is the contract between the game
 * and whatever draws it.  docs/RENDERER.md has the design and the numbers.
 *
 * Three coordinate spaces, and every item says which one it is in:
 *
 *   SCREEN  GBA screen coordinates, 0..239 x 0..159 on hardware.  What the
 *           emulated PPU would have drawn there.  Menus, title screens and
 *           anything the list cannot prove is world-anchored.
 *   WORLD   GBA screen coordinates relative to the game's own camera, but
 *           *unbounded*: a world layer has real content for any x, and a
 *           world sprite carries its full-precision s32 position from before
 *           the 9-bit OAM truncation and the game's on-screen cull.  The view
 *           may be any size and may be moved off the game camera (clamping at
 *           a room edge), and world items follow it.
 *   HUD     screen space, but each item is anchored to an edge or corner of
 *           the view rather than to a 240x160 rectangle.
 *
 * What is still GBA-shaped, on purpose, for this cut: tiles and palettes are
 * referenced by VRAM address and palette RAM index (the backend keeps a texture
 * cache of both, uploaded when they change), and layer composition follows the
 * GBA rules (four priorities, two blend targets, windows).  MODDING.md M9
 * replaces the VRAM references with resource ids -- RlTileLayer.map and
 * RlSprite.tile are the fields that change; the spaces, the anchoring, the
 * effect description and the sprite order do not.
 *
 * Nothing in this file, and nothing that builds a list, writes game memory.
 * The game-side hooks (PortRl*) are write-only from the simulation's point of
 * view: they copy game state into host memory and return.  `make regress`
 * with the renderer on is the check.
